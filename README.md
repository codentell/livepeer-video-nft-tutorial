### Step 2: Setting up Livepeer CLI
Navigate to a folder 📁 where your video file 🎥  is located 

* Example: `livepeer.mp4`

![Step  2.1](./images/5.png)

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the `Livepeer CLI` (Command Line Interface):

```bash
npm install -g @livepeer/video-nft
```

![Step  2.1](./images/6.png)

### Step 3. Run the `video-nft` command

Run the following command in your terminal: `video-nft.`

![Step  3.1](./images/7.png)

* Enter your `Livepeer API key.`

* Enter the name of the  `.mp4` file you want to use 

* Name you want to give to your NFT

* Optionally customize the metadata for your `video NFT` by hitting `Y` or `N.`

Once your video has successfully uploaded, you will get an object with fields, including your IPFS hash containing your metadata:

```JSON
{
  "videoFileCid": "QmRNZBCDtuBcvmX1W8U3M9xuEqRYLv6P7mNw8m1v1b91Wt",
  "nftMetadataCid": "QmYwabdPZDpcdQf2indzCSWhko8fPvKRAWXoFm5Ka1JB31",
  "videoFileUrl": "ipfs://QmRNZBCDtuBcvmX1W8U3M9xuEqRYLv6P7mNw8m1v1b91Wt",
  "videoFileGatewayUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmRNZBCDtuBcvmX1W8U3M9xuEqRYLv6P7mNw8m1v1b91Wt",
  "nftMetadataUrl": "ipfs://QmYwabdPZDpcdQf2indzCSWhko8fPvKRAWXoFm5Ka1JB31",
  "nftMetadataGatewayUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmYwabdPZDpcdQf2indzCSWhko8fPvKRAWXoFm5Ka1JB31"
}
```

The last line after the successful upload provides a URL like this: 

https://livepeer.com/mint-nft?tokenUri=ipfs://QmYwabdPZDpcdQf2indzCSWhko8fPvKRAWXoFm5Ka1JB31

A modal should popup:
![Step  3.1](./images/8-5.png)

You can pass in your custom `ERC721 contract` address or use the contract provided by `Livepeer.`

![Step  3.1](./images/8.png)

Click `Connect to Metamask` button
![Step  3.1](./images/10.png)

Choose either `Polygon Testnet` or `Polygon Mainnet.`

`Only Polygon network is supported right now.`

![Step  3.1](./images/12.png)

# Step 4. Mint your Video NFT

Prerequisite: 
* Be sure to have your `Metamask` network configured to the `Polygon Testnet` or  `Polygon Mainnet.`

 If you click on the button `Polygon Testnet` or `Polygon Mainnet,` it should configure your metamask to add and change your network. 

* Be sure to have some Matic Token in your `Metamask` wallet

#### Polygon Mainnet 
Polygon faucet can be found at https://matic.supply.

Make sure your `Metamask` or web 3.0 wallet is connected to the Polygon blockchain. 

![Polygon Mainet](./images/14.png)


#### Polygon Testnet
If you need some Testnet Matic, go to this URL https://faucet.polygon.technology/. 

![Polygon Testnet](./images/13.png)

* After navigating to the URL provided, you can leave the contract field blank and default to Livepeer's contract. 

![Polygon Testnet](./images/17.png)

*  Hit `"Mint NFT"`

You'll have to confirm the transaction and pay for the gas in `Metamask`.

# Building a dApp using the SDK 

Lets build a video uploader that uses the sdk that you can later mint to polygon 

### Step 1. Setup Video NFT Backend Server

```bash
mkdir video-nft-server
```

Next run these commands: 

#### npm
```bash
cd video-nft-server 
npm init 
```

#### yarn 
```bash
cd video-nft-server
yarn init
```


* Install the following npm packages to your package.json

#### npm
```bash
npm install --save @livepeer/video-nft cors dotenv express multer
```

#### yarn
```bash
yarn add @livepeer/video-nft cors dotenv express multer
````
